1. WAP for creating a mini calculator for performing a particular operation based on user choice. ex. 
if the user will select the addition operation then the output should be the addition of the given two nos.


package com.demo;

public class Calculator 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println("Hello This is Simple Calculator...");
		int num1=100;
		int num2=20;
		System.out.println("Addition is       :"+num1+num2);
		System.out.println("Subtraction is    :"+(num1-num2));
		System.out.println("Multiplication is :"+num1*num2);
		System.out.println("Division is       :"+num1/num2);
		System.out.println("Modulus is        :"+num1%num2);
	}
}
Output:
Hello This is Simple Calculator...
Addition is       :10020
Subtraction is    :80
Multiplication is :2000
Division is       :5
Modulus is        :0

2.WAP for creating a banking Application .you have to take input from the user whether the user wants to deposit, withdraw, or find a current balance.
package com.demo;

public class A 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
    	int account_Number = 434567;
    	String  account_HolderName = "Ankita Yemul";
    	
    	double initial_Amount = 50000.00;
    	double deposit_Amount = 7000.00;
    	double withdrawl_Amount = 2000.00;
    	double result;
    	
    	System.out.println("Acount Number :");
    	System.out.println(account_Number);
    	System.out.println("Name Of Account Holder :");
    	System.out.println(account_HolderName);
    	System.out.println("Initial Amount in Account :");
    	System.out.println(initial_Amount);
    	
    	System.out.println("----------------------------");
    	
    	System.out.println("Deposit Operation :");
    	result = initial_Amount+deposit_Amount;
    	System.out.println("Amount Deposited..");
    	
    	System.out.println("----------------------------");
    	
    	System.out.println("Withdrawl Operation :");
    	result=result-withdrawl_Amount;
    	System.out.println("Amount Withdrawn succesfully.");
    	
    	System.out.println("-----------------------------");
    	
    	System.out.println("Printing Final Balance : ");
    	System.out.println(result);
    }
}
Output:
Acount Number :
434567
Name Of Account Holder :
Ankita Yemul
Initial Amount in Account :
50000.0
----------------------------
Deposit Operation :
Amount Deposited..
----------------------------
Withdrawl Operation :
Amount Withdrawn succesfully.
-----------------------------
Printing Final Balance : 
55000.0
